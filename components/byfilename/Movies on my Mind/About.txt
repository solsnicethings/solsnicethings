This is a lighthearted sharing of thoughts and feelings in the context of movies.			("Lighthearted" proves false here and there)

		Or other similar things; I'm not beholden to my exact words on this.

I do not aim to be precise or informed. I just want to talk about how thoughtless, misguided and self-defeating the jedi are, how they have taken actual concerns about the relationship between fear and power, and reduced them to simplistic axioms forming a framework of absolute terror that someone might stray from the mandated path.

And how incredibly nice David Lynch seems. A lot of famous people are famous for very different things than being nice and thoughtful. Actors are inherently prone to being famous for traits and actions other than their own. But although he is famously strange in person and in art, every time David Lynch makes you a motion picture, it is like he is trying (and succeeding) to do something very thoughtful and kind.

I have actually not watched most of his work. Or been able to follow it. (Much of what I did watch already, I watched with people who study art, and they seemed to be experiencing the surreal and disconcerting on a level out of my reach.)

I hope to. Most of the "must watch" and "must read" is just going to sit there. Other people will, I don't particularly want to, and if I never do it is nobody's loss but mine, so nobody should worry more about it than I do (and I don't). But the youtube videos and movies of David Lynch.

That is kindness breaking through. I want it. And in this one instance, I trust it.
