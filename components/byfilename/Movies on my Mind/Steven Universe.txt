	THIS IS PRETTY WILD

And wonderful. Very short episodes. Starts off surreal. Gets very serious, beautiful and queer. Never serious in a dull way. Rarely not silly. But often silly in a deep and interesting way.

And the music is great! Short tunes, catchy, pretty, cool, often fully integrated.

Some of the episodes are... disturbing, though. Rebecca Sugar goes places where I'm a little bit afraid to look. Most kids probably handle it better when tone and narrative part ways. I don't say this as a criticism. I skip one crossover episode; that guy is too much for me, and that episode is silly in a way that I can not... embrace.

It is very eloquent and insightful about worth, sense of self, sense of belonging, relationships, reconciling expectations and realities, and the complex tensions between many things that we are to one another. And I really like the power na√Øvety has in these stories. I cry a bit, laugh a lot, and adore many of the characters -and I feel like the show expresses compassion for most or all of them, without ever asserting that compassion in service of injustice.

I am quite kind. I think.

This show is kinder than I am.
