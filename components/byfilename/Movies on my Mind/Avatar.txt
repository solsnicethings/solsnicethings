So many things are Avatar!

I think the only one I like is Avatar: the last airbender (the original very well drawn and well thought out TV-show).

It is very exciting to watch the fights and sort of believe the motions that are presented on the screen. The contact, the interaction. When Aang is sort of maintaining light contact with his opponent's back, and it really conveys the sense that this helps him maintain the relative position he seeks.

The emotional narratives are also well made, and touch on many things that are often not well taught and explained when we need it the most.

Finally, a troublesome feeling: the charm and confident ease of an experienced guardian and companion, the apparent wisdom of a general who seems to have been in no way burdened by the horrors he has willingly inflicted on others. (There are strong indications that he both has dealt with and is dealing with things in ways that cause him strong feelings without having those feelings dominate his demeanor, which I think is why he seems not to be burdened by his actions.)
