I quite like Dan Aykroyd.

At least I think I do. He seems to invest his love in his work. I find that charming.

I'm not here to swoon, though. (I guess I used to adore him a great deal as Elwood.)

I'm here to say things like, but not exactly the same as "the ghost librarian really got me. So... scared. Not quite as scary now. And actually not nearly the most disturbing thing in that movie."

The part that has its claws in my guts is... in a way... the music gets... a very pronounced touch of doomsday-montage. And it makes all the comedy spirits of evil and unlife... seem truly malicious and motivated. If not for the music, it would not unsettle me more than a colourfully crayoned aerial shot.
