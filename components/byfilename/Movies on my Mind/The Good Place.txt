This is also not a movie! But I'm keeping the alliteration.

"Movies and more on my magical mind."

The theme melody for this show is... spot on. It has no language component, yet it is able to tell part of the story.

It starts off so competently absurd, and sweet and odd, and always funny. You will notice quite early on that it has a point of view, an interest, and quite an opinion. It is fully a masterpiece.
