There are many things I like, but do not feel inspired to describe, explain, promote, ponder, critique or discuss. I might care to mention them in passing, though.

	Twin Peaks				Garth Marenghi's Darkplace

					Wikipedia (yes, it doesn't belong in the TV/Movie categorisation, and I don't care: it is one of painfully few promises about sharing of information and furthering of knowledge that the internet has kept)

		Flight of the Conchords				She-Ra and the Princesses of Power				Kissing Jessica Stein
Jenny Nicholson - HBomberguy - Philosophy Tube - nebula.tv (get it via your favourite youtuber if you wish to support them in particular) - Mia Mulder - Maggie Mae Fish - Sami Kelsh - Shaun - Folding Ideas - Little Joel - Big Joel - Last Week Tonight

	(I have also heard a glowing recommendation of The Graham Norton Show. Seen a few clips on that basis, via the BBC website. The highlights were very entertaining.)
	
Andor			Luke's refusal to give up on the basis of only the Jedi's absolutist semi-fatalism				Star Trek (in spite of certain shortcomings of many seasons and episodes)
	(Oh... John de Lancie... I seem to be here to swoon afterall)
